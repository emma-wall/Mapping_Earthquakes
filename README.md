# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview 
This repo has examples of mapping points, linesstrings and polygons on plotly maps, which lead up to the bigger project of mapping the location and magnitude of earthquakes in the past 7 days. 

## Results 
The final map has 3 map sytles to choose from along with 3 different overlays of earthquakes and tetonic plates. It also features a legend to show the magnitude of each earthquake that is mapped.
